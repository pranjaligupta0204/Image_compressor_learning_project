## Image Compressor using Python

This is a simple project created to learn and explore the use of **Python’s Pillow (PIL)** and **Tkinter** libraries.  
It allows users to select an image, compress it by resizing and reducing its quality, and then save the optimized version easily.

## Features
- Select any image through a simple GUI window  
- Compress and resize the image automatically  
- Save the compressed image to your desired location  
- Uses **Tkinter** for file dialogs and **Pillow** for image processing

## Learning Outcome
A beginner-friendly project that helps understand:
- Image manipulation using Pillow  
- Basic GUI handling using Tkinter  
- Working with file selection and saving dialogs

## How It Works
1. Select an image file using the Tkinter file dialog.  
2. The script resizes the image to 50% of its original dimensions.  
3. It saves the new image as a JPEG with optimized quality (set to 60).
